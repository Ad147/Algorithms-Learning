8.1 Events
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- event, elementary event
- space of elementary events: a set of all elementary events
- certain event: is all space of elementary events
- impossible event (∅): an empty subset of a space of elementary events
- identical events (A=B)
- A involves B (A⊂B): B occured follows A occured
- sum (A∪B)
- product (A∩B)
- difference (A-B)
- complementary events
- mutually exclusive（互斥） events (A∩B = ∅)
- equally likely events

8.2 Definition and Basic Properties of Probability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- axiomatic and classical definitions of probability
- basic properties of probability:
  1. P(∅) = 0
  2. A⊂B⊂E => P(A) <= P(B)
  3. P(A) <= 1
  4. P(A') = 1 - P(A)
  5. P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
