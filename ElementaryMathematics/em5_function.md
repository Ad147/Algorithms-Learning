5.1 Functional Dependence between Two Variables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- constants, variables
- 2 variables are tied by a functional dependence, if for each value of one of them it is possible to receive by the certain rule one or some values of another
- argument (independent variable): a variable with values given
- function: values are found by the certain rule
- single-valued function
- multiple-valued function
- representation of function by formula: $E = mc^2$
- representation of function by table
- designation of functions: $y = f(x)$

5.2 Coordinates, Graphical Representation of Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- coordinate system
- Cartesian coordinates
- axes and origin（原点） of coordinates
- abscissa（横坐标）/x-coordinate, ordinate（纵坐标）/y-coordinate
- graphical representation of functions

5.3 Basic Notions and Properties of Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- domain（定义域）, codomain（值域？）
- rule (law) of correspondence
- function definition: such a rule (law) of a correspondence between a set X and a set Y, that for each element of a set X one and only one element of a set Y can be found, is called a function
- monotone function
Bounded and unbounded function. Continuous and
discontinuous function. Even and odd function.
Periodic function. Period of a function.
Zeros (roots) of a function. Asymptote.
