7.1 Basic Notions, Examples of Sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- set, element of a set
- finite set, empty set (∅), infinite set
- countable set (finite or infinite), uncountable set (infinite)
- convex set（凸集）: any two its points A and B contains also the whole segment AB
  - straight line
  - plane
  - circle (not circumference)
- methods of description of sets
  - an enumeration of all its elements by theirs names (for example, a set of books in a library, a set of pupils in a class, an alphabet of any language and so on)
  - by giving of common performance (common properties) of elements of the set (for instance, the set of rational numbers, the family of dogs, the family of cats etc.)
  - formal law of forming elements of the set (for example, the formula of a general term of numerical sequence, Periodic table of chemical elements)

7.2 Operations with Sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- designation of sets and their elements
  - $a ∈ R ; a \notin R$
- equality of sets: consist of the same elems
- subset (inclusion)
  - $A ⊂ B$
- sum (union) of sets
  - $A ∪ B$
- product (intersection) of sets
  - $A ∩ B$
- difference (complement) of sets
  - $A - B$
- symmetric difference of sets
  - $A \ B = (A-B) ∪ (B-A)$
- properties of operations with sets
  1. $A ⊂ B, B ⊂ C => A ⊂ C$ (transitivity)
  2. $A ⊂ B, B ⊂ A => A = B$
  3. $A ∪ A = A$
  4. $A ∪ ∅ = A$
  5. $A ∩ A = A$
  6. $A ∩ ∅ = ∅$
  7. $A - A = ∅$
  8. $A ∪ B = B ∪ A$ (commutability of addition)
  9. $A ∩ B = B ∩ A$ (commutability of multiplication)
  10. $(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)$ (associativity of addition)
  11. $(A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)$ (associativity of multiplication)
  12. $A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)$ (distributivity of multiplication over addition)
  13. $A ∩ (B - C) = (A ∩ B) - (A ∩ C)$ (distributivity of multiplication over subtraction)
  14. $A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)$ (distributivity of addition over multiplication)
