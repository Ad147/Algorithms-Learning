2.1 Rational Numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- rational numbers: positive and negative numbers

> A number is called rational, if it may be presented as a vulgar, not a cancelled fraction of the shape: m/n, where m is an integer and n is a natural number.

- absolute value (modulus（模）)

2.2 Monomials and Polynomials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- monomial（单项式）
- coefficient （系数） of a monomial
- similar/like monomials: identical or differed only be coefficients
- polynomial（多项式）
- degree of polynomial: the most degree of monomials forming the polynomial

2.3 Formulas of Abridged Multiplication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- $(a \pm b)^2 = a^2 \pm 2ab + b^2$
- $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
- $(a \pm b)^3 = a^3 \pm 3a^2b + 3ab^2 \pm b^3$
- $(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a^3 + b^3$
- $(a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = a^3 - b^3$

2.4 Division of Polynomials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- division of polynomials（多项式除法）
- long division（长除法）
- linear binomial（线性二项式）: a polynomial of the 1st degree: $ax + b$
- division of polynomial by linear binomial
- Bezout's theorem（裴蜀定理）:  
  a polynomial $a_0 x^m + a_1 x^{m-1} + ... + a_m$ is divided by $x – b$ with a remainder $N = a_0 b^m + a_1 b^{m-1} + ... + a_m$

2.5 Divisibility of Binomials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As consequences from Bezout’s theorem:

1. a difference of identical powers of two numbers is divided without a remainder by a difference of these two numbers,  
   i.e. (x^m – a^m) is divided by (x – a)
2. a difference of identical even powers of two numbers is divided without a remainder both by a difference and by a sum of these two numbers,  
   i.e. if m is an even number, then the binomial x^m – a^m is divided both (x – a) and by (x + a)  
   a difference of identical odd powers of two numbers isn’t divided by a sum of these two numbers.
3. a sum of identical powers of two numbers is never divided by a difference of these two numbers
4. a sum of identical odd powers of two numbers is divided without a remainder by a sum of these two numbers
5. a sum of identical even powers of two numbers is never divided both by difference and by a sum of these two numbers

- factoring of polynomials（因式分解）

2.6 Proportions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- crosswise lied terms can be changed by places
- ratios in any proportion can be changed by places
- derived proportions:  
  $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \implies \frac{ma + nb}{ka + lb} = \frac{mc + nd}{kc + ld}$$
  where m, n, k, l - any numbers

Algebraic Equations
================================================================================

2.7 Equations: Common Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- equality: 2 expressions (numerical or literal ones) jointed by sign "="
- identity: a valid numerical equality or a literal equality valid at *any* numerical values of letters
- equation: a literal equality valid only at *some* values (roots of an equation) of letters (unknowns)
- solving: procedure of finding all roots
- equivalent equations: have the same roots

2.8 Main Ways Used at Solving of Equations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- identical transformations: replace equation by equivalent one:
  1. replacement of identical expression
  2. transferring terms of equation from one side to another
  3. multiplication/division of both sides by non-zero expression (number)
  4. raising/extracting both sides to/of an *odd* power/degree root:
     1. *even* power result in extraneous roots
     2. a *wrong* extraction of *even* degree root result in loss of roots

2.9 Systems of 2 Simultaneous Linear Equations in 2 Unknowns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- linear equation in one unknown（一元一次方程）
- systems of two simultaneous linear equations in two unknowns（二元一次方程组）
- 2 basic solution methods:
  1. substitution（代入？换元？）
  2. addition or subtraction of equations
- the second order determinants（二阶行列式）
- Cramer's rule: solution using determinants
- investigation of solutions:
  1. coefficients at unknowns are disproportionate: single solution
  2. all coefficients are proportional: has an *infinite set of solutions*
  3. coefficients at unknowns are proportional, but disproportionate to free terms: no solutions

2.10 Systems of 3 Simultaneous Linear Equationss in 3 Unknowns

- the third order determinants
- Cramer's rule for solution

2.11 Irrational Numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- arithmetical root
- algebraic root
- irrational numbers
- formula of complicated radical（？）:  
  $$\sqrt{a \pm \sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 - b}}{2}} \pm \sqrt{\frac{a - \sqrt{a^2 - b}}{2}}$$

2.12 Quadratic Equation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- quadratic equation（二次方程）
- non-reduced quadratic equation: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
- reduced quadratic equation: $x^2 + px + q = 0$

2.13 Imaginary and Complex Numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- imaginary numbers（虚数）
- imaginary unit: $i = \sqrt{-1}$
- real number（实数）
- complex number（复数）

2.14 Roots of a Quadratic Equation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \implies x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
$$ x^2 + px + q = 0 \implies x = -p / 2 \pm \sqrt{(p/2)^2 - q} $$

- discriminant（判别式）
  1. $b^2 - 4ac > 0$: 2 roots are different real numbers
  2. $b^2 - 4ac = 0$: 2 roots are equal real numbers
  3. $b^2 - 4ac < 0$: 2 roots are imaginary numbers
- Viete's Theorem（韦达定理）:  
  $x_1 + x_2 = -p$  
  $x_1 * x_2 = q$
- factoring of a quadratic trinomial:  
  $$ ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - x_1)(x - x_2) $$

2.15 Equations of Higher Degrees
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- biquadratic equation（四次方程？）: $ax^4 + xb^2 + c = 0$  
  solution: exchange $z = x^2$
- cubic equation: $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$  
  the known Cardano’s formulas for solution are very difficult and almost aren’t used in practice  
  another way to solve:
  1. find 1 root by selecting (these equations have always at least one real root, and an integer root of a cubic equation with integer coefficients is one of factors of a free term d). Coefficients of these equations have been selected usually so that the root is among not great integers, such as: 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, assume this root is x1. 
  2. the 2nd stage of solution is dividing of $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ by $x – x_1$. According to Bezout’s theorem this division is possible without a remainder, and receiving a quadratic equation, solving which we’ll find (or not!) the rest of the two roots.

Vectors and Complex Numbers
================================================================================

#### 2.3.1 Principles of Vector Calculus

- **Vectors**, **opposite vectors**, **zero vector**
- **Length (modulus) of vector**
- **Collinear vectors**, **Coplanar  vectors**
- **Equality  of  vectors**, **Addition  of  vectors**
- Laws of addition of vectors, Laws of multiplication of vector by a number
- **Scalar  product  of vectors**: a product of lengths (modules) of these vectors by cosine of angle between them
- **Angle between non-zero vectors**, **Scalar square**
- A scalar product of two vectors is:
  - positive, if an angle between the vectors is *acute*
  - negative, if an angle between the vectors is *obtuse*
  - A scalar product of two non-zero vectors is equal to zero, if and only if an angle between the vectors is *right*, i.e. these vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal)
- Properties of a scalar product
- **Unit orthogonal vectors**: In any rectangular system of coordinates it is possible to introduce unit two-and-two orthogonal vectors i, j and k, connected with coordinate axes: i for x-axis,  j for y-axis and k for z-axis. Any vector a can be expressed through these vectors by  the only way: a = xi + yj + zk. Another form of  the record is: a = (x, y, z). Here x, y, z – *coordinates of the vector* a in this system of coordinates.
- **Vector product of vectors**, Properties of a vector product
- **Necessary and sufficient condition** of collinearity of vectors
  $$ \begin{vmatrix} x & y \\ u & v \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} x & z \\ u & w \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} y & z \\ v & w \end{vmatrix} = 0 $$
- Necessary and sufficient condition of coplanarity of vectors
  $$ \begin{vmatrix} x & y & z \\ u & v & w \\ p & q & r \end{vmatrix} = 0 $$

#### 2.3.2 Complex Numbers

- **Complex numbers**: `abscissa` + `ordinate` i
- **Conjugate complex numbers**: a + bi & a - bi
- **Pure imaginary number**

### 2.4 Inequalities

#### 2.4.1 Mathematical Induction

Assume it's necessary to prove a statement (formula, property etc.), depending on a natural number n. If:

1. this statement is valid for some natural number n0,
2. from validity of this statement at n = k its validity follows at n = k + 1  for any k >= n0,

then this statement is valid for any natural number n >= n0.

#### 2.4.2 Inequalities: Common Information

- **Inequality**: more, less
- **Strict inequality**: $\gt, \lt$
- **Non-strict inequality**: $\geq, \leq$
- Some important inequalities:
  1. $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$ (modulus of sum is not more than sum of the modules)
  2. $a + 1/a \geq 2$, a - positive
  3. $\sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{a + b}{2}$ a, b - positive (geometric average is not more than arithmetic average, also for n numbers)

#### 2.4.3 Proving and Solving of Inequalities

- Basic methods of proving of inequalities:
  1. Using of the known or before proved inequality
  2. Estimating of the sign of difference between sides of inequality
  3. Reductio ad absurdum proof

- **Geometric progression**: $b_n = b_1 + q^{n - 1}$, $S_n = \frac{b_1(1 - q^n)}{1 - q}$
