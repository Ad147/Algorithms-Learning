Types of Joints

- synovial（（含）滑膜的） joints: can move
  1. hinge
     - move in 1 direction
     - flexion, extension
     - elbow
  2. pivot
     - rotate in long axis
     - pronation, supination
     - radio-ulnar joint
  3. ball & socket
     - flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, circumduction
     - hip, shoulder
  4. ellipsoid
     - like ball, but prevent rotation
     - flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction
     - wrist
  5. saddle
     - like ellipsoid
     - flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, slightly rotate
     - carpometacarpal joint of thumb
  6. plane
     - glide, rotate
     - carpals, tarsals, acromioclavicular（肩峰锁骨）
- fibrous and cartilaginous（软骨的）: hardly move
  - spine
    1. cervical（颈） section of neck: 7 vertebrae (only 7th visible)
       - most flexable, do all motions (3 axis)
       - first 2 (atlas and axis) form a pivot joint, and do 50% of rotation and flex/extend
    2. thoracic（胸） section of ribcage: 12 vertebrae (1 for each rib)
       - attached to ribcage, relatively still
       - only rotation, flex/extend and lateral are minimal
    3. lumbar（腰） section of lower back: 5 vertebrae
       - largest and strongest vertebrae
       - flexion/extesion and lateral bending
    4. sacrum（骶骨） and coccyx（尾骨）
