Figure Drawing Design and Invention: 01 Gesture Drawing
================================================================================

A~0g28

Throughout the book, a "gesture drawing" as considered the frame work for everything plan to accomplish;  
"gesture" is like an armature（骨架） to a sculpture, a rig to a 3D model.

1 The 8 Parts of the Body
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. head
2. pelvis（骨盆）
3. spine
4. rib cage（胸腔）
5. arm * 2
6. leg * 2

"CSI": the most crucial lines to show a figure.

> Correct propotion:  
> avoid slow, methodical measuring, that stiffens（僵硬） the poses;  
> instead, when looks incorrect, change it

2 Form and Balance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important thing to keep in mind while darwing the figure is that the human form is essentially（本质） a balancing act.

Head, neck, rib cage, pelvis, legs are in "S" shapes for balance.

3 Symmetry and Asymmetry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use asymmetrical "S" lines to develop gesture;  
this emphasize a natural sense of balance and movement;  
the eye is forced to move through lines, that gives control viewer's eye goes.

Avoid using symmetry (mirroring or parallel), this closes off the form visually

4 Repetition and Timing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A similar curve or shape is repeated twice or more, it provokes a visual movement, lines lead the eye.

5 Wrapping Lines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a quick sketch, wrapping lines are curves that move across and around a form to indicate perspective (describe the way the form is moving through space).

At this point, keep the head shape a sphere, the rib cage an egg, the pelvis an oval laying.

6 The Spine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spine is responsible for the organization and balancing of the 3 major masses, as well as arms and legs,  
most everything in the figure can be explained as a consequence of the spine

The "S" curve of spine:
- cervical（颈椎）
- thoracic（胸椎）
- lumbar（腰椎）

in different spatical direction.
