Figure Drawing Design and Invention: 01 Gesture Drawing
================================================================================

A~0g28

Throughout the book, a "gesture drawing" as considered the frame work for everything plan to accomplish;  
"gesture" is like an armature（骨架） to a sculpture, a rig to a 3D model.

1 The 8 Parts of the Body
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. head
2. pelvis（骨盆）
3. spine
4. rib cage（胸腔）
5. arm * 2
6. leg * 2

"CSI": the most crucial lines to show a figure.

> Correct propotion:  
> avoid slow, methodical measuring, that stiffens（僵硬） the poses;  
> instead, when looks incorrect, change it

2 Form and Balance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important thing to keep in mind while darwing the figure is that the human form is essentially（本质） a balancing act.

Head, neck, rib cage, pelvis, legs are in "S" shapes for balance.

3 Symmetry and Asymmetry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use asymmetrical "S" lines to develop gesture;  
this emphasize a natural sense of balance and movement;  
the eye is forced to move through lines, that gives control viewer's eye goes.

Avoid using symmetry (mirroring or parallel), this closes off the form visually

4 Repetition and Timing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A similar curve or shape is repeated twice or more, it provokes a visual movement, lines lead the eye.

5 Wrapping Lines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a quick sketch, wrapping lines are curves that move across and around a form to indicate perspective (describe the way the form is moving through space).

At this point, keep the head shape a sphere, the rib cage an egg, the pelvis an oval laying.

6 The Spine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spine is responsible for the organization and balancing of the 3 major masses, as well as arms and legs,  
most everything in the figure can be explained as a consequence of the spine

The "S" curve of spine:
- cervical（颈椎）
- thoracic（胸椎）
- lumbar（腰椎）

in different spatical direction.

7 Center of Gravity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a dynamic pose involves creating a sense of tension with the figure's center of gravity.

Avoid straight figure, make major masses move around the center of gravity (vertical line based on feet?) without lining up on it.

8 Rib Cage and Pelvis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When placing rib cage and pelvis, make sure they are consistent with the spine and the balance of the gesture.

When the majority of weight is positioned on one leg, it usually cases this large area of bone to raise, dropping the other side

9 The "About to ..." Pose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "about to ..." pose is somewhere in mid-action, presenting dynamic sense, and making viewers wanting to anticipate the story.

The diff between a stable pose and one in mid-action is determined by how weight is distributed and balanced;  
build a triangle between the feet and either the belly button（肚脐） or nose, in stable poses, the tri mostly appears very stable at the bottom, in out of balance poses, the tri looks more irregular.

10 Economy of Line
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harder/sharper lines describe abrupt changes in plane or light: box edge, cast shadow edge, head, landmark points, bone.

Softer edge gives slower visual exp, is for smoother, softer areas: muscle, fat.

11 Creating a Story
