Anatomy Terms

by Proko

Anatomical Position (reference position) – Standing figure with feet together, arms down and supinated

### The Three Anatomical Planes

Sagittal Plane – A vertical line, divides the body into a left and right

Coronal Plane – A vertical line, divides the body into a front and back

Transverse Plane – A horizontal line, divides the body into a top and bottom

### Terms of Location

Anterior – Toward the front of the body
Median – Located on the midline of the torso or limbs

Posterior – Toward the back of the body
Lateral – Toward the side of the body, away from the middle

Medial – Toward the middle of the body, away from the side

Superior – Toward the top, above

Proximal – Situated nearer to the center of the body or the point of attachment

Deep – Not visible on the surface, covered with something else

Inferior – Toward the bottom, below

Distal – Situated away from the center of the body or from the point of attachment

Superficial – Visible on the surface

Subcutaneous – Just below the skin, specifically referring to the bony landmarks

Origin (of a muscle) -Where the muscle attaches to a part of the body that doesn’t move, or moves very little

Insertion (of a muscle) – Where the muscle attaches to a part of the body that will move when the muscle pulls

### Terms of Movement

Flexion – Bending movement that decreases the angle between two parts (e.g bending the elbow)

Extension – Straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts (e.g straightening the elbow)

Abduction – Movement away from the midline (e.g lift arm up to side)

Adduction – Movement towards the midline (e.g lower arm back to hip)

Medial Rotation – Rotating movement towards the midline (e.g rotating the knee inward)

Lateral Rotation – Rotating movement away from the midline (e.g rotating the knee outward)

Elevation – Movement in a superior direction (e.g shoulder shrug)

Depression – Movement in an inferior direction (e.g shoulder down)

Protraction – Movement in the anterior direction (e.g shoulder forward)

Retraction – Movement in the posterior direction (e.g shoulder back)

Pronation – Rotate the palm of the hand so that it is facing posteriorly, or down (e.g typing on a keyboard)

Supination – Rotate the palm of the hand so that it is facing anteriorly, or up (e.g holding a bowl of soup)

Dorsiflexion – Flexion of the foot at the ankle so the foot points superiorly, and rotating the hand so the back of the hand moves closer to the forearm

Plantarflexion – Extension of the foot at the ankle, so the foot points inferiorly

Palmarflexion – Rotating the hand so the palm of the hand moves closer to the forearm

Opposition – Bring the thumb and little finger together

Reposition – Move the thumb and little finger away from each other

Circumduction – The circular movement of a limb, a combination of flexion, extension, adduction and abduction

Inversion – Movement which faces the sole of the foot inwards

Eversion – Movement which faces the sole of the foot outwards

### Quantity

- Bi – Two
- Tri – Three
- Quad – Four

### Size

- Minor/Minimus – Small
- Major/Maximus/Vastus/Magnus – Great/Large
- Brevis – Short
- Longus – Long

Pedal – Of the Foot

Palmar – Of the Palm of the hand

Plantar – Of the Sole of the foot

Cervical Region – Part of spinal column comprising the neck

Thoracic Region – Part of spinal column comprising the thorax or chest

Lumbar Region – Part of spinal column comprising the dorsal section of umbilical region

Sacral Region – Part of spinal column comprising the pelvic area

Coccyx Region – Part of spinal column comprising the tail bone
