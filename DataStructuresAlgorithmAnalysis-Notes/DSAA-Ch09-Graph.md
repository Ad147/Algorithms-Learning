Chapter 9 Graph Algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, we will...

- Show several real-life problems, which can be converted to problems on graphs.
- Give algorithms to solve several common graph problems.
- Show how the proper choice of data structures can drastically reduce the running time of these algorithms.
- See an important technique, known as depth-first search, and show how it can be used to solve several seemingly nontrivial problems in linear time.
