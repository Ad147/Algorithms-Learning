How to Draw: Chapter 04 Creating Grids
================================================================================

A~0e27

4.1 Perspective Grid Types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 1-point perspective drawings: simple to transfer proportions, just scale
- 2-point perspective drawings: gives viewer a good idea of orientation
- 3-point perspective drawings: most dynamic view; keep HL off the page or close to top/bottom edge to make the best use
- 5-point perspective drawings or curvilinear perspective: fish-eye-lens

4.2 1-Point Grid Construction, Diagonal Vanishing Point
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 1-point grid construction with vanishing points on the page
  - in this case 45VP is the diagonal vanishing point
- DVP: VP of diagonals of squares with a specific rotation
- divide a square in 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 and draw diagonals of the rectangles to get 45, 25, 15 and 7 deg angles precise enough for hand-drawn constructions

4.4 2-Point Grid Construction with Vanishing Points on the Page
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- for 45/45 grid, CVP coincides with DVP
- rotated 2-point grids with same-sized squares
  - use incircle of square (ellilpse in perspective) to correct sizes of grids

4.6 Transferring Scale in Perspective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- transfer height when moving around on a ground plane
  1. draw a line from base of object, in direction it will move, to HL and create a reference point (RP1)
  2. draw from height to RP1
  3. draw vertical that intersects both lines, it will be the same height in perspective
  4. to move left or right, just draw height lines parallel to HL
- standing on a box in the distance
  1. construct height planes to RP1, through the box
  2. locate the standing point on the box and ground
  3. take the height of figure standing on the ground and transfer to standing on box
- standing in a hole in the distance
  1. find the height directly above the side wall
  2. transfer the height to the bottom of hole
  3. to move around in the bottom of hole, repeat the steps creating RP2

4.7 The Brewer Method: Constructing a Grid with Vanishing Points off the Page
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-point grid using 4 establishing lines:

1. draw a vertical as front corner of a box
2. draw 2 lines converge toward right off page, defining position of RVP and HL
3. draw from bottom of vertical toward left
4. draw a vertical parallel to existing vertical on right side
5. draw a rectangle parallel to PP, starting from height of right vertical line, intersecting the line going left
6. draw from top of first vertical through top-left rectangle corner to LVP
7. divide and extend to create grids

4.8 Creating a Grid of Squares, without Diagonal Vanishing Points
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. use the grid just created as underlay
2. place correct ellipse into bounding area (with 3 bounds defined)
3. close it with a fourth edge
4. extend the squares
5. transfer a square to ground plane, defining 3 bounds
6. place an ellipse on ground and cap the square with a tangent line
