How to Draw: Chapter 05 Ellipses and Rotations
================================================================================

A~0e30

Drawing ellipses is the basis for hinging flaps, ratating objects, constructing spiral staircases, and generate grids with squares in any direction.

5.1 Ellipse Basics and Terminology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- minor axis
  - always intersects center of circumscribed square
  - always perpendicular to ellipse's surface
- ignore major axis
- ellipse degree: measure of angle of line of sight into surface of ellipse

5.2 Placing a Circle in Perspective or Drawing Ellipse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. define a vertical surface upon which to draw the circle in perspective; draw a line perpendicular to the surface to define minor axis direction
2. draw an ellipse and estimate degree of ellipse, then draw a bounding box (to test if correct the degree is)
3. correct ellipse need to fulfill:
   - touch left vertical line halfway
   - touch upper and lower line at points vertically aligned
   - touch closing vertical line at halfway point as well
4. try to find the correct ellipse meeting all conditions

5.3 Creating a Cube Using Ellipse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating cubes in perspective is very useful for both creating grids and controling proportions of objects in perspective.

1. define height and front corner of cube over a perspective grid, this establishes minor axis VP
2. place an ellipse on each side, tangent to corner
3. add vertical lines tangent to ellipse to define the proportions of a cube

5.4 Offsetting Ellipses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modify size of ellipse while keeping degree unchanged, if the ellipses are kept rather close together along minor axis.  
When moving far along minor axis into deeper perspective, change degree;  
just redraw a defining prespective square to double-check the degree

5.5 Hinging and Rotating Flaps and Doors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor axis is the hinge in drawing;  
Ellipse is path of points rotated.
