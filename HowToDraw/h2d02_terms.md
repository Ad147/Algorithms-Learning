2.1 Defining the Perspective by the Viewing Position
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that photography is being replicated in the drawings;  
therefore, it is essential to define *standing position, viewing direction, and used lens*.  
This knowledge will apply to the guessed perspective, the constructed perspective, and even computer-generated perspective.

### Defining Point of View (POV)

1. ground plane (standing surface or the extension of soles of feet)
   - station point (SP) (where the camera is, location and height)
   - line of sight (determines both direction being looked and the incline)
     - if parallel to ground, creating 1- or 2- point perspective
     - if not parallel, creating 3-point perspective or even 5-
2. picture plane (PP)
