How to Draw: Chapter 06 Working with Volume
================================================================================

A~0f05

At the center of accurately drawing volumes in perspective is an understanding of "drafting" which is the skill of drawing the same object from multiple views without any perspective convergence.

6.1 Panning Before Perspective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a good idea to develop a plan by sketching several simpler views before jumping into elaborate perspective construction drawings.

6.2 Orthographic Views, aka Orthogonal Views or Draft Views
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orthographic views of an object are seen from only one side without any perspective convergence;  
also called draft views, orthos, orthogonal views.

6.3 Transferring a Side View into Perspective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. create a bounding rectangle that can be divided evenly into squares, within rectangle draw a shape in side view;
   - conversely, draw shape then rectangle, make sure rect divided evenly into squares
2. add more lines to create more intersection points
   - try extending shorter sections of shape to see where to intersect bounding rect (these helps when lightly added to the perspective planes and then used to sketch in finished sections)
3. create a bounding rect in persp with same proportions as side view
4. look for alignments and intersection points on the draft view that correspond to similar points on the persp view; look for intersections where shape's lines cross lines of persp grid rects

6.4 Putting It All Together: X-Y-Z Section Drawing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. start with a Y plane to define the centerline of the form
2. define a flat plane that the volume will be sitting on by adding some persp guidelines going to LVP; locate guidelines at intersection of vertical guidelines and bottom of centerline; determine the width of the top view by adding guidelines going to RVP; draw top view on Z plane
3. mirror top view to the far side of Z plane
4. sketch a line of the mirrored top view through ref points
5. add X sections at any of the section loactions defined by persp guidelines crossing Y and Z planes; they can be sketched on either side of centerline; just sketch one half for now
6. add and mirror remaining X sections
7. the X-Y-Z shape comes together with the drawing of silhouette line

6.5 Extending the Sections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. extend grid and draw extended centerline for any shape desired
2. extend X section lines into any shape
3. mirror X sections over to the other side
4. silhouette of extended form can now be drawn

6.6 2-Curve Combo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. start with a persp grid and a centerline
2. sketch top view of one half and extend vertical construction lines where X sections cross top-view line
3. extend height of centerline out from top view to intersect these verticals, thereby creating ref points used to help draw the combination line of two curves
4. draw the 2-curve combo line through ref points
5. mirror 2-curve combo line over to the other side, find ref points
6. draw the morrired curve

6.7 Cutting Volumes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- car windshield
  1. draw a grid with a vertical plane and a horizontal plane
  2. draw a basic rect plane with 2 angled X sections
  3. connect narrower top edge to the flat ground plane; this tapering plane construction happens to be the basis for constructing the windshield of a car
  4. place an ellipse on the vertical plane; place a Y section on the center of ellipse
  5. place 2 more Y sections that are tangent to ellipse to the left and right
  6. project a few points from ellipse along Y-axis until they intersect with the section lines of the inclined plane
  7. slice up ellipse with a few more lines to create more points to project forward, again along Y-axis; once a point has been projected forward, it can be mirrored to the other side of centerline
  8. sketch a curved line through projected points
- cut a wheel into automotive body
  1. begin with a more complex volume
  2. sketch the shape of the hole to be projected into curved surface
  3. construct 3 new sections, 2 X and 1 Z, at strategic spots to help project the cutting curve onto outer surface of the volume;  
     locate X sections tangent to widest dimensions of projection curve and place Z plane a little higher up to provide 2 more ref points for the resulting cutout
  4. transfer intersections of new section planes and the desired cutting curve outward along X-axis until they intersect outer surface of the form, creating ref points
  5. sketch a curve through ref points

6.8 Adding Radii and Fillets (fil'-itz)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is common to blend 2 intersecting planes with either a radius or a fillet ("fill it").  
A radius connects planes with an outward curve, removing volume;  
and a fillet connects planes with an inward curve, adding volume.

1. start with 2 boxes to blend together, decide what corners to radius
2. draw ellipse on sides of the box as if theyare ends of cylinders running parallel to corners to radius; draw tangencies of cylinder surfaces on sides of box
3. draw corner parts, notice cut off parts
4. add a fillet, and therefore volume, to blend 2 boxes forms together; draw ellipses that touch tangent to surfaces of boxes
5. extend fillet vertically until it intersects with the one running horizontally, blending the top of small box with the side of larger one; add extra line weight to define final hard edges

6.9 Wrapping Graphics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wrapping graphics onto an object is like wrapping a label on a bottle or adding a sticker onto a surface.

1. start with a volume that the graphic will wrap onto
2. the graphic is floating in space with left edge touching the surface of cylinder
3. try to predict the wrapping of label by first rotating it around the contact edge of cylinder
   - use an ellipse with its minor axis places at left edge of label
   - this foreshortens the length and gets it close to correct area
4. as the label wraps across the curvature of surface it becomes even narrower and not reaching the line created by ellipse; make a guess

6.10 Detailing and Sculpting Surfaces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. start with a basic 2-curve combo and a top view placed a bit wider on the ground plane
2. connect front ground line and outside top-view line on both sides with symmetrical sections; draw a tangency ref line for X sections on side of form
3. modify X sections with radii using ref line from step 2, mirror them to far side
4. to add a notch into upper-front corners
   1. draw notch in side view at centerline
   2. transfer notch to left and right and intersect it with surface of the form
   3. project bottom of notch, resulting in section lines
   4. to define inside corner, prject a line, starght across to LVP from one side to the other
   5. drop a vertical to intersect the line and connect points
5. project a curved line onto side of form by drawing it first on centerline plane, then project it out to vertical X-section lines, creating ref points
6. draw the resulting curve through ref points  
   more surface variation can be made by punching holes into surface by either defining new X sections  
   or by defining top and bottom of an opening, and then adjusting centerline section to move front surface back into volume
7. to define surface of indented detail
   1. draw top view of new curving vertical surface on the ground plane
   2. slice new X-section lines to LVP wherever to place
   3. draw angled fillet that leads from front corner back to X section first drawn
   4. draw new section lines, mirror one to far side to see visibility
8. working in reverse can also be done by sketching a line anywhere on the surface and then determining X sections, if any, or leaving as a design line
9. this design line can be the start of a tansitional form change; all that is needed are a few X sections to communicate the form
10. add a new hole at the lower front; also 2 ares, where forms will be added, are defined on top
11. create the 2 added forms on top by first drawing a centerline along with 2 X sctions for each
12. after sections drawn, add silhouette of each
13. section lines communicate design lines to form changes

6.11 More Tips for Modifying Complex Volumes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- intersecting volumes using a temporary construction plane
  1. start with a 2-curve combo with slightly convex X sections running across it
  2. to project a teardrop shape onto surface, located on its cneterline
     - draw the shape where it can be seen clearly, which makes it easier to draw
     - if drawing on ground is tough, extend persp grid down, creating a temp construction Z plane
  3. project shape up into main surface; use X sections to locate ref points to sketch projected teardrop onto surface
  4. float a smaller, similar shape directly above centerline of the main surface and project it downward
  5. transfer width of X sections and sketch the resulting projection on surface

6.12 Contour Lines, Overlapping and Line Weight
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. contour lines are the same as section lines but they are not constrained bt the X-Y-Z persp grid, they can run in any direction that helps to define the surface
2. line weight can bring a sketch to life after main persp work done
   - eyes are drawn first to thepoint of highest contrast, use this to your advantage
   - make sketch more attractive by increasing the contrast and line weight in areas where viewers should look first; this become natural facal points so be sure that the outlining and increased values align with visual message of sketch
3. where one line overlaps another, the weight is thicker to visully set it in front of the other
4. to strenthen persp and overlap effects, use increased line weight to make overlapping forms more obvious, and keep this techique going into distance while also lowering overall value andscale of lines to give a stronger impression of persp
