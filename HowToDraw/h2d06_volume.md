How to Draw: Chapter 06 Working with Volume
================================================================================

A~0f05

At the center of accurately drawing volumes in perspective is an understanding of "drafting" which is the skill of drawing the same object from multiple views without any perspective convergence.

6.1 Panning Before Perspective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a good idea to develop a plan by sketching several simpler views before jumping into elaborate perspective construction drawings.

6.2 Orthographic Views, aka Orthogonal Views or Draft Views
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orthographic views of an object are seen from only one side without any perspective convergence;  
also called draft views, orthos, orthogonal views.

6.3 Transferring a Side View into Perspective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. create a bounding rectangle that can be divided evenly into squares, within rectangle draw a shape in side view;
   - conversely, draw shape then rectangle, make sure rect divided evenly into squares
2. add more lines to create more intersection points
   - try extending shorter sections of shape to see where to intersect bounding rect (these helps when lightly added to the perspective planes and then used to sketch in finished sections)
3. create a bounding rect in persp with same proportions as side view
4. look for alignments and intersection points on the draft view that correspond to similar points on the persp view; look for intersections where shape's lines cross lines of persp grid rects

6.4 Putting It All Together: X-Y-Z Section Drawing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. start with a Y plane to define the centerline of the form
2. define a flat plane that the volume will be sitting on by adding some persp guidelines going to LVP; locate guidelines at intersection of vertical guidelines and bottom of centerline; determine the width of the top view by adding guidelines going to RVP; draw top view on Z plane
3. mirror top view to the far side of Z plane
4. sketch a line of the mirrored top view through ref points
5. add X sections at any of the section loactions defined by persp guidelines crossing Y and Z planes; they can be sketched on either side of centerline; just sketch one half for now
6. add and mirror remaining X sections
7. the X-Y-Z shape comes together with the drawing of silhouette line

6.5 Extending the Sections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. extend grid and draw extended centerline for any shape desired
2. extend X section lines into any shape
3. mirror X sections over to the other side
4. silhouette of extended form can now be drawn

6.6 2-Curve Combo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. start with a persp grid and a centerline
2. sketch top view of one half and extend vertical construction lines where X sections cross top-view line
3. extend height of centerline out from top view to intersect these verticals, thereby creating ref points used to help draw the combination line of two curves
4. draw the 2-curve combo line through ref points
5. mirror 2-curve combo line over to the other side, find ref points
6. draw the morrired curve

6.7 Cutting Volumes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- car windshield
  1. draw a grid with a vertical plane and a horizontal plane
  2. draw a basic rect plane with 2 angled X sections
  3. connect narrower top edge to the flat ground plane; this tapering plane construction happens to be the basis for constructing the windshield of a car
  4. place an ellipse on the vertical plane; place a Y section on the center of ellipse
  5. place 2 more Y sections that are tangent to ellipse to the left and right
  6. project a few points from ellipse along Y-axis until they intersect with the section lines of the inclined plane
  7. slice up ellipse with a few more lines to create more points to project forward, again along Y-axis; once a point has been projected forward, it can be mirrored to the other side of centerline
  8. sketch a curved line through projected points
- cut a wheel into automotive body
  1. begin with a more complex volume
  2. sketch the shape of the hole to be projected into curved surface
  3. construct 3 new sections, 2 X and 1 Z, at strategic spots to help project the cutting curve onto outer surface of the volume;  
     locate X sections tangent to widest dimensions of projection curve and place Z plane a little higher up to provide 2 more ref points for the resulting cutout
  4. transfer intersections of new section planes and the desired cutting curve outward along X-axis until they intersect outer surface of the form, creating ref points
  5. sketch a curve through ref points
