How to Draw: Chapter 02 Perspective Terminology

2.1 Defining the Perspective by the Viewing Position
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that photography is being replicated in the drawings;  
therefore, it is essential to define *standing position, viewing direction, and used lens*.  
This knowledge will apply to the guessed perspective, the constructed perspective, and even computer-generated perspective.

### Defining Point of View (POV)

1. ground plane (standing surface or the extension of soles of feet)
   - station point (SP) (where the camera is, location and height)
   - line of sight (determines both direction being looked and the incline)
     - if parallel to ground, creating 1- or 2- point perspective
     - if not parallel, creating 3-point perspective or even 5-
2. picture plane (PP) (like a plate of glass perpendicular to line of sight)
   - how far doesnot matter as the proportions do not change

2.2 Cone of Vision (COV)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lens determines how much of the area will be seen through the lens.

The optimal lens that creates an acceptable amount of distortion is a 50mm lens,  
and this translates into the drawing as a 60deg cone of vision.

1. 1-point linear perspective: use 50deg COV
2. 2-point and 3-point linear persp: 60deg
3. 5-point curvilinear persp: open choice

2.3 Finding Vanishing Points on the Picture Plane
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. parallel lines converge to a VP
2. use top view and move one of the lines parallel to SP, the point parallel line intersects HL is VP
3. visual ray method for persp drawings: shows a combination of top view and PP; a straight line from SP intersects HL at center VP
4. to find a new set of 90deg VP, just keep the angle at SP 90deg
5. use the new set to draw a new box sitting on the same ground; a common error that object like floating is caused by not matching VP to the same COV
6. to find degree of any VP measures its deviation from the perpendicular line to HL from SP; to achieve 90deg box, the deviation of LVP and RVP will added up to 90deg
7. the 30deg VP located at edge of 60deg COV, while center of COV is CVP

2.4 Physical Parallel Lines Converge to a Common Vanishing Point
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exceptions: in linear constructions for 1-point and 2-point perspective.  
Bacause 1- and 2- are made for more efficiency by not having all parallel lines converge.

- in 1-point perspective, only convergence into the depth of drawing, all lines parallel to PP do not converge
- in 2-point perspective, verticals do not converge

2.5 Horizon Line Relative to Position
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the line of sight parallel to the ground, HL split the COV in half, and will be higher or lower with the SP.

When tilting head (line of sight not parallel to ground), there will be a 3-point perspective, HL not split COV in half, still stay with the SP height.
