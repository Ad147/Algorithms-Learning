> The term `algorithm` is used to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.
>
> Algorithms and data structures go hand in hand.  
> Data structures exist as the byproducts or end products of algorithms and that we must therefore study them to understand the algorithms.
